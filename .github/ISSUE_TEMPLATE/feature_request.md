#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [debugging guide](/docs/operating.md)** for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [configuration settings](/docs/configuration.md).
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+repo%3Aslo-exporter)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most of users.
* **Specify which version you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `slo-exporter --version` in your terminal.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**
